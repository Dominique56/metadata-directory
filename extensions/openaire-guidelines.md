title: OpenAIRE Guidelines for institutional and thematic repositories, data archives and CRIS systems
slug: openaire-guidelines
description: <p>The OpenAIRE Guidelines are a suite of application profiles
  designed to allow research institutions to make their scholarly outputs
  visible through the OpenAIRE infrastructure. The profiles are based on
  established standards and designed to be used in conjunction with the
  OAI-PMH metadata harvesting protocol to foster FAIR principles:</p>
  <ul><li>The OpenAIRE Guidelines for <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1299203">institutional and thematic Repositories</a> are based on
  <a href="../standards/dublin-core.html">Dublin Core</a>;</li>
  <li>The OpenAIRE Guidelines for Data Archives are based on the
  <a href="../standards/datacite-metadata-schema.html">DataCite Metadata
  Schema</a>;</li>
  <li>The OpenAIRE Guidelines for CRIS Managers is based on
  <a href="../standards/cerif.html">CERIF</a>.</li></ul>
  <p>While the focus of each profile is different, they allow for interlinking
  and the contextualization of research artefacts.</p>
